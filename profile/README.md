# MEPEKlay
MEPEKlay is multi-wallet dashboard & web3 DAO community maker. By connecting one or more wallets from multiple chains to your personal dashboard, you can collect and view the assets (e.g. Tokens, NFTs, etc.) in the wallets. It allows you to easily make your community using NFTs and transfer tokens to your friends on the Klaytn ecosystem.
<br/><br/>
# What It Does
MEPE is a service for individuals and organizations that create Web 3.0 DAO communities. Users can easily create their own DAO community NFT and manage their communities & members. (e.g. buy me a coffee NFT, coupon, community membership, etc.) It provides an incredibly simple way to create membership NFTs without smart contracts and blockchain knowledge.

# Challenges we ran into
**How can the transfer layer be made easier?**
- We tried our best to make the process of connecting wallets and sending tokens to friends as easy as possible.
- We made UX/UI simple.
- It allows to send money just by pressing a friend's profile picture.
- Then a user can select which token to transfer, from which wallet to which wallet. Changing the wallet or token is easy as well.
- We made both wallets to be able to link to one's profile, and connect / disconnect is so easy.
- KIP-17 has been adopted to facilitate the issuance, distribution, and airdrop of NFTs.
- There are various benefits in NFT coupons and mamberships.
- We improved readability of mobile UX/UI as well.
<br/><br/>

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
